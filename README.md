## Hubble Tension: Constraining the Hubble parameter using time-delay gravitational lensing experiments and comparison with other methods.

### Author's note/README

This paper represents the literature review dissertation for my BSc (Hons) Natural Sciences (Astronomy and Planetary Sciences) issued by The Open University (Milton Keynes, United Kingdom) in October of 2022. 

My brief was to conduct a literature review related to my previous study in a current area of astronomy research presented in less than 5000 words; this work is designed to be accessible to any undergraduate or postgraduate student of General Relativity. (I received 85% for this work which for non Brits is a 1st and thus the highest grading work can receive at undergraduate level so I think it's fair to say it does this well). 

I am making this work available online in the hopes that other students and non-specialists find it a helpful introduction to this exciting area of research - more research has certainly occurred since this was written but this covers the state of research between 2015 - 2022.

I have no intention of submitting this to a journal, only to leave it here for posterity. 

If you are a student of the Open University feel free to use my bib config - it's compliant with the OU Harvard implementation and was a pain to figure out, save yourself some effort and just use it. 

If you wish to use this work in part, including the figure I created, for non commercial or educational work I'd appreciate a citation - I believe GitHub can be cited as a typical online work.

I also did two conference talks on this topic and the pre requisite physics knowledge required to understand the concepts at Newline 2023 - livestream VODs are available on the Hackerspace Gent YouTube channel, presentation skews slightly less technical & mathematical due to the predominantly astronomy enthusiast audience. (Forgive my awkwardness, it was my first time presenting research to an audience).
